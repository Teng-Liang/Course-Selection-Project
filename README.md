# Course-Selection-Project
This project implements a course selection program that allowed students to register for courses and an admin to edit. It utilizes NYU courses as data and constructed the program through Object-Oriented Programming. Furthermore, pipeline and data structures as well as serialization are employed to enrich the program.
